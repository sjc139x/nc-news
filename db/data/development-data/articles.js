      "1. Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl. Add the butter and rub together with your fingers to a fine breadcrumb-like texture (you can also do this part in a food processor). Stir though the icing sugar, then quickly add the egg yolks and 2 tbsp water, mixing swiftly with a cutlery knife to combine. Form into a ball (add another tbsp water if you need to), wrap and chill for 30 mins. Roll out to the thickness of a pound coin, and line a 22cm fluted tart tin with the pastry, leaving an overhang. Return to the fridge for 30 mins. 2. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put a baking sheet into the oven to heat up. Line the pastry case with baking parchment and baking beans, then put in the oven on the baking sheet, and bake for 15 mins. Remove the parchment and bake for a further 10 mins or until the pastry is golden brown. Leave the pastry to cool before trimming off the overhanging edges with a small serrated knife. 3. Lower the oven temperature to 160C/140C fan/gas 4. Combine the golden syrup, ginger, ginger syrup, lemon, eggs and breadcrumbs in a bowl, briefly whisking everything together until combined. Carefully pour the filling into the pastry case put in the lower part of the oven to bake for 35-40 mins or until the filling is just set. Remove from the oven and leave to cool down for 20 mins before serving with ice cream or thick clotted cream.",

Whisk the drained chickpea liquid with an electric whisk until white, fluffy and just holding its shape – be persistent, this will take longer than you imagine. Gradually whisk in the caster sugar until your chickpea meringue reaches stiff peaks. Spoon the vegan meringue onto the baking parchment and bake for 1hr 30 mins, or until they come off the paper easily. Leave to cool. 2. Meanwhile, mix the berries with the icing sugar and rose water. Set aside for 30 mins so the flavours infuse and the berries release some of their juices. 3. Put the yogurt into a large bowl, crush in the meringues then stir through 1/3 of the fruit, rippling it through the yogurt.

      "I worked at a new hot restaurant in Birmingham. We were a huge place with 3 dining rooms and a banquet room. We had people waiting at the door everyday at 4pm waiting to get in because we had awesome specials like our 1lb. Prime rib with a baked potato, salad and our homemade croutons….all for £9.95. People went nuts over this! Well once a year in the summer we ran a special with a Maine lobster for £15.95. One evening a server came back and asked the cooks that this lady was requesting a lobster barely cooked. So she wanted it still somewhat alive and moving, medium rare! I was very uncomfortable with this and disturbed. I know it’s just a lobster and we throw them in hot boiling water ALIVE, but they die instantly. She wanted this sucker still moving so that means she would be eating it while it’s still alive. I refused but the manager approved it and did it himself. I was bothered by this for some time and it still bothers me to this day! Chefs - what are your best (and by that I mean weirdest) customer requests?",

      "It is definitely a struggle to switch your eating habits, and takes time to find new ways to spice up healthy foods-but it's not impossible. There are so many foods out there that can kick your craving for the 'unhealthy' foods. Try eating your vegetables with hummus, or mix them up into a good chicken or salad dish, nuts can also be thrown into a good salad. Don't be afraid of salad dressings, hummus, etc. They are all good IN MODERATION! Another way to make it less 'boring' is to change the snacks you have everyday. Maybe instead of nuts and veggies for your snack-you have a smoothie, a protein bar, tuna packet, pretzels & hummus (they sell them in a small package). There are endless options and ways to stick to healthy foods on a daily basis.",

      "1. Chocolate: No, this is not a joke. Chocolate is actually a healthy food. Dark chocolate is better than milk or white chocolate since dark has the antioxidants and anti-inflammatory substances that are good for your heart. One or two Dove dark chocolate squares make the perfect dessert for the health-conscious with a sweet tooth. // 2. Cheese: Cheese has a bad rap for being a fattening, heart-threatening food choice, but there are many cheeses that offer lean protein, calcium and phosphorous. Next time you’re craving some, go for these lower calorie choices: // 3. Popcorn: Stay away from the brands drenched in butter and salt (movie popcorn, ladies and gentleman), and you have yourself a healthy snack. Popcorn contains antioxidants, fiber and is entirely whole grain. Pick up Pop Secret’s 94 percent Fat Free Butter for a healthy choice that is still packed with flavor. // 4. Beer: Next time you’re drinking a cold one (or even a warm, flat one in someone’s basement), pat yourself on the back for helping out your heart. Recent studies have shown that drinking about a pint a day can lower your risks of stroke, heart attack and other heart-related disease by up to 30 percent. Cheers! // 5. Avocado: For a long time, avocados have been plagued with the “fattening” label.  While they are high in fat, it is monounsaturated fat, the kind that helps out your heart. Stick to monounsaturated fats, cut out saturated fats and you have got yourself a healthy diet. // 6. Burgers: The key is to make sure that the cows were grass-fed. These burgers are chock full of Vitamin E, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are great for a healthy heart.",

Still, the dounut as we know it today are said to have been created by Elizabeth Gregory in the mid 19th century. She was the mother of a New Englan Ships Captain, who made a delicious fried dough dish using the spices that her son shipped. In the center of the dough she would put nuts as she feared the center might not cook through as well. So it was literally dough with nuts in in, doughnuts. Her son is the one credited with putting the hole in the center of the donut (thus getting rid of the need for the nuts).",

Sieve the flour with the cayenne pepper and then stir into the sweetcorn mixture. 2. Add the oil to a large frying pan – you need to shallow fry these, so make sure the base of the pan is well covered. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Heat the oil then test by adding a tiny bit of the batter – it should immediately start bubbling around the edges when it hits the oil. Using a small ladle, drop batter onto the oil – you need around 2 tbsp of mixture per fritter. You should be able to fry 4–5 at any one time. Fry for a couple of minutes on one side until light brown then turn over and cook for a further minute. 3. Turn out onto kitchen paper to remove any excess oil and keep warm in a low oven. Continue until you have used all the batter.",

First the place is always totally clean. Servers bring your order and get you anything you need. They also clean your garbage away. All done in a manner that is so nice and helpful it is shocking when compared to other fast food places. The lines moves fast, even though everything is cooked to order. If you want a refill on your drink, someone will get it and serve it to you with a smile. It is obvious the company treats their employees very well. My favorite is the grilled chicken sandwich. So tasty. Lots of choices for sauce, but I use very little. And their lemonade is memorable.",

Specialised tea and coffee: we can be responsible with our beverages if we try a little, and our tastebuds will thank us. 5. Doughnuts: any flavour you can imagine, any time of the day.",

      "We tend to think of health food as a modern invention, but humans have made the connection between food and well-being at least since the beginning of written history—although it's always been as much a matter of educated guesswork as solid science. Ancient Greeks believed that good health was dependent on maintaining the balance of the body's four 'humors'—black bile, yellow bile, phlegm and blood—and that modifications in diet could restore balance if levels got out of whack. Hippocrates, Plutarch and other thinkers wrote books on the relationship between food and health, including Galen's On the Power of Foods, a title that sounds like it could have been written last year.",

      "What if, for once, your Thanksgiving sides were just as dazzling as the centerpiece turkey? Imagine a world where presenting a platter of seasonal vegetables inspires the same amount of cooing that the turkey does. Welcome to the world of twice-baked butternut squash. Sure, you could just roast some squash wedges and call it a day. But where's the fun in that? To make this year's most impressive vegetable side, Epi's food director Rhoda Boone gave super-seasonal butternut squash the twice-baked potatoes treatment: Mash the inside of the vegetable with butter, cream, and anything else that might make it more delicious, then pile it back into the vegetable, bake it until golden and velvety. The result is a jaw-dropping, brightly colored sweet-meet-savory butternut squash side dish. Here are just a few more reasons this creation belongs on this year's Thanksgiving table:",

Here’s the plan for the week, not including breakfast because I’m on a farina kick and that’s not to everyone’s taste, and not including lunch because really when it comes to the midday hours you should get out of the office or the house and walk around. If you get something to eat, great, but the most important thing is to be outside where the stories are. There’s nothing happening at your desk but a screen. Anyway! I’m thinking chicken paprikash for dinner tonight, a nod toward the coming fall, served over buttery egg noodles, with green beans on the side. If you have the time, make an apple cake for dessert.",

      "'SEAFOOD fraud is a serious global problem', begins a recent report from Oceana, an NGO. Reviewing over 200 studies in 55 countries, the report finds that one in five fish sold has been mislabelled. Although fish fraud is common early in the supply chain, most of it comes at the retail level. In 65% of cases, the motivation is economic—slippery restaurateurs frequently serve up cheaper fish than they advertise to cut costs. In America, Oceana has reported instances of tilapia being sold as the more expensive red snapper. Especially brazen fish criminals have invented new types of fish entirely. In Brazil, researchers were puzzled to find markets selling 'douradinha', ' non-existent species. Close inspection found that 60% of such fish were actually 'vulture' catfish, a relatively undesirable dish. Reports in America of catfish being substituted for more expensive fish date back to at least 2002; Oceana’s study suggests that the phenomenon is spreading.",

If they were still hungry, I told them, they could help themselves to more sausage, but they were not allowed to grab a slice of bread, or toast an English muffin, or pour themselves a bowl of cereal. This represented a reversal of the usual strictures, and they were happy to oblige. It was like some weird, unexpected holiday—Passover in July.",

      "The chef Richard McGeown has faced bigger culinary challenges in his distinguished career than frying a meat patty in a little sunflower oil and butter. But this time the eyes and cameras of hundreds of journalists in the room were fixed on the 5oz (140g) pink disc sizzling in his pan, one that had been five years and €250,000 in the making. This was the world’s first proper portion of cultured meat, a beef burger created by Mark Post, professor of physiology, and his team at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. Post (which rhymes with ‘lost’, not ‘ghost’) has been working on in vitro meat (IVM) since 2009. On 5 August this year he presented his cultured beef burger to the world as a ‘proof of concept’. Having shown that the technology works, Post believes that in a decade or so we could see commercial production of meat that has been grown in a lab rather than reared and slaughtered. The comforting illusion that supermarket trays of plastic-wrapped steaks are not pieces of dead animal might become a discomforting reality.",
